<user_request>Create a modern, elegant, and professional academic journal website named Journal of Multidisciplinary Research Horizon (JMRH) — a peer-reviewed open-access publication for interdisciplinary research.

The design should blend academic sophistication with modern digital clarity, reflecting credibility, trust, and innovation.
